# Thesis-Final-Code
Code that is used to obtain the results as presented in my thesis report
Every file contains a lot of documentation and comments, so please open the files and read the comments. Some overall remarks are given below:

Functions2, arms6 and arm8 contain the main algorithms. 
Functions2 contain the basic Riemannian gradient descent algorithm to rotate one vector.
arms6 contains the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm for robotic arms, which does NOT use arc lenght initialization
arms8 contains the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm for robotic arms, which does use arc lenght initialization

Then we have some other files which perform the alogirithm and/or plot some results
rotation_in_n.py is a simple script
